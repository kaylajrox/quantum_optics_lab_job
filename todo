- unit test to ensure the values in the array of distance btween the peaks match table cell values
- ask user for plotting only a certain duration and channel to not overwhelm with lots of plots
- use the correct data table to make a new comparison of spacing between the peaks for each voltage (y axis the spacing and x axis the gain voltage)
# TODO put the processed data from coincidence in results folder outputs there
# TODO auto generate plot images to go into a separate folder so they are easier to retrieve
# TODO finish detailed readme with the images that explain the code results, add images showing off features like peak-selector
