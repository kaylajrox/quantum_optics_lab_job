- unit test to ensure the values in the array of distance btween the peaks match table cell values
- ask user for plotting only a certain duration and channel to not overwhelm with lots of plots
- use the correct data table to make a new comparison of spacing between the peaks for each voltage (y axis the spacing and x axis the gain voltage)
